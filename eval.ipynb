    "### How to interpret Rouge score\n",
    "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores are a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries generated by automatic summarization systems, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These metrics compare the generated summary against one or more reference summaries, typically produced by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-N (N-gram Overlap): This metric measures the overlap of n-grams (sequences of n words) between the generated summary and the reference summaries. ROUGE-N is often computed for different values of N (e.g., ROUGE-1 for unigrams, ROUGE-2 for bigrams, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence): ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence between the generated summary and the reference summaries. This metric is particularly useful when the order of words is important for the summary's coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher scores indicate better performance: A higher ROUGE score generally indicates that the generated summary is more similar to the reference summaries, suggesting better quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to interpret Meteor score\n",
    "A higher METEOR score indicates better performance. A score closer to 1 indicates a higher level of similarity between the generated translation and the reference translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to interpret Bert_score\n",
    "BERTScore measures the similarity between the generated text and one or more reference texts. It considers the contextual embeddings of the text fragments to capture the semantic similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other evaluation metrics, BERTScore typically ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match between the generated text and the reference text, and 0 indicates no similarity."

The repurchase activities are as follows: - In the quarter ended June 25, 2022, Apple repurchased 408 million shares of its common stock for $65.0 billion under a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. - In the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Apple repurchased 133 million shares of its common stock under an authorized share repurchase program for $19.0 billion, excluding excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. - In the quarter ended April 1, 2023, Apple repurchased 262 million shares of its common stock under an authorized share repurchase program for $38.1 billion, excluding excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. - In the quarter ended July 1, 2023, Apple repurchased 365 million shares of its common stock for $56.1 billion, excluding excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

    "In the most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin compared to previous quarters include: 1. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. 2. Lower Products volume, which decreased gross margin. 3. Cost savings and a different Products mix, which partially offset the decrease in gross margin. For the third quarter of 2023, the Products gross margin percentage increased compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, despite the negative impact of foreign currency weakness and decreased leverage. However, the year-over-year Products gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to the weakness in foreign currencies and decreased leverage, despite cost savings and a different Products mix. The Services gross margin increased due to higher Services net sales but was partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies and higher Services costs. The Services gross margin percentage decreased due to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage. SOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf\t\n",
